# Changes from the default template

- custom style (`dusky-lory.css`)
  - used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to make a palette
  - imported a Google Fonts resource
- using [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) to get my profile image
- fixed `head.html` to correctly include `og` and `twitter` meta tags
  - NOTE: need a minimum of (either `og:` or `twitter:`) `title` and `image` to work; looks best with `description` as well
- added a short bio link to `settings.json` -> para markup in `index.html`
- added Stack Overflow and Ko-fi icons to `social.html` footer
  - used SVGs from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)
- borrowed [Tweet links](https://glitch.com/~tweet-links) template, updated to use timelines as well as Tweets and customised params to match theme

# TODO / ideas

- ~~add Tweet timeline~~
  - make this fold up?
- add Revue social link (edit social template)
- refactor the SVGs out from the `social` template to make it cleaner

(thought, as I continue to poke... this is addictive... need to think about curating a list like this to keep it fresh, relevant, and useful)
